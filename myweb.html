          Basketball coaching is the act of directing and strategizing the
          behavior of a basketball team or individual basketball player.
          Basketball coaching typically encompasses the improvement of
          individual and team offensive and defensive skills, as well as overall
          physical conditioning. Coaches also have the responsibility to improve
          their team by player development, strategy, and in-game management.
          Coaches also teach and inspire their team to be their best.

          A dry erase clipboard or tablet computer with a basketball court
          outline is often used mid-game to describe plays and provide an
          overview of the strategy of the opposing team. Coaches strategize and
          scout opposing teams and find ways to defeat them as easily as
          possible. At the same time, they overlook their own personal team to
          start the best five players (only five players can be on floor at one
          time). Coaches, also, have to be aware of substitutes to put in
          throughout the game so they can be fresh. A drill designer is used to
          sketch drills, plays and information. Coaches also utilise file
          managers to store all coaching materials in one place and access from
          anywhere. Planners are also used to blueprint strategies and game
          plans.
